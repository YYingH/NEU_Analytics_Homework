    "    - eg: What the data needed for producing the solution is, in what format it is needed, how much data is needed, and so on, You also discuss what the outputs of the analysis and predictive model will look like and how they provide solutions for the problems that are being discussed.\n",

What are the relationships between the features? Do we observe outliers? How do the different pairs of features correlate with each other? Do these correlations make sense? What is the relationship between the features and the target?\n",
